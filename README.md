# Matrix Inverse Using Differential Evolution
Differential evolution (or computational intelligence algorithms in general) can be used to find or to converge close to finding the 
inverse of a matrix, where the matrix can be of any size. The advantage here is that even if a matrix is singular, the algorithm can 
find a value that is close to the inverse. This technique of finding an inverse works much faster than conventional methods.
